      <h4>Part 1: Budgeting — The Foundation of Financial Wellness</h4>
      <p>
        <strong>Why Budgeting Matters</strong><br />
        A budget is a game plan for your money. It gives you a clear path for spending, saving, and achieving your financial goals. Without a plan, overspending becomes inevitable and saving — nearly impossible.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>How to Create a Simple Budget</strong><br />
        1. List your net monthly income from all sources.<br />
        2. Track all your expenses for a month: start with fixed bills, then variable spends like eating out and entertainment.<br />
        3. Group your expenses into "needs" (e.g., rent, groceries), "wants" (dining out, subscriptions), and "savings/debt".<br />
        4. Use a method that fits your life:
        <ul>
          <li><em>50/30/20 Rule:</em> 50% needs, 30% wants, 20% savings or debt repayment.</li>
          <li><em>Zero-based budgeting:</em> Assign every rupee/dollar a job until nothing is left unallocated.</li>
          <li><em>Envelope/Cash Stuffing:</em> Withdraw cash and divide it by spending category.</li>
          <li><em>Apps &amp; Digital Tools:</em> Try Mint, YNAB, or Walnut for auto-tracking and reminders.</li>
        </ul>
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Budgeting Tips for Success</strong>
        <ul>
          <li>Make your budget realistic — over-tightening leads to burnout.</li>
          <li>Build "fun money" in for leisure and little joys, guilt-free.</li>
          <li>Review your spending and adjust categories every month.</li>
          <li>Automate bills and savings transfers to avoid missed goals.</li>
        </ul>
      </p>

      <h4>Part 2: Smart Saving — Building a Strong Safety Net</h4>
      <p>
        <strong>The Emergency Fund</strong><br />
        Life is unpredictable. Job loss, medical expense, or even a broken fridge can strike when you least expect. Build an emergency fund with 3–6 months' living costs to ensure you survive tough times without going into debt.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>How Much To Save?</strong><br />
        Start with at least 1 month's expenses and build up over time. Once your emergency fund is set, dedicate money towards bigger life goals — a dream vacation, wedding, home, or retirement.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>High-Impact Saving Hacks</strong>
        <ul>
          <li><em>Pay Yourself First:</em> Treat savings as non-negotiable; automate transfers to a separate account on salary day.</li>
          <li><em>Audit Recurring Expenses:</em> Cancel unused subscriptions; switch to more affordable plans.</li>
          <li><em>Expose Hidden Spending:</em> Small daily purchases add up! Track them and identify cutback areas.</li>
          <li><em>Use Cashbacks &amp; Offers:</em> Shop during sales and use cashback apps for additional savings.</li>
        </ul>

      <h4>Part 3: Investing — Making Your Money Work For You</h4>
      <p>
        <strong>Understanding Investment Vehicles</strong><br />
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Stocks:</strong> Ownership in companies, with the potential for high returns and higher risk.</li>
          <li><strong>Mutual Funds &amp; ETFs:</strong> Professionally managed collection of stocks/bonds for instant diversification.</li>
          <li><strong>Fixed Deposits &amp; Bonds:</strong> Lower risk, fixed returns — good for capital safety.</li>
          <li><strong>Gold &amp; Real Estate:</strong> Great for hedging against inflation and long-term wealth creation.</li>
        </ul>
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>The Power of Compound Interest</strong><br />
        Your money earns interest, and that interest itself earns interest — leading to exponential growth over time.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Key Investment Principles</strong>
        <ul>
          <li>Start early — even tiny regular investments grow big over years.</li>
          <li>Don't chase "get rich quick" schemes. Consistency and patience win.</li>
          <li>Review and rebalance your portfolio annually to match your goals &amp; risk tolerance.</li>
          <li>Never put all your eggs in one basket — diversify!</li>
        </ul>

      <h4>Part 4: Debt — The Good, The Bad, and the Dangerous</h4>
      <p>
        <strong>Good Debt</strong> is used to invest in assets that grow in value (e.g., a student loan, home loan).
        <br>
        <strong>Bad Debt</strong> comes from overusing credit cards or high-interest personal loans for things that don't grow in worth.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Repayment Strategies</strong>
        <ul>
          <li><em>Debt Snowball:</em> Pay off your smallest debts first for quick wins and motivation.</li>
          <li><em>Debt Avalanche:</em> Prioritize the highest-interest debt to save the most money over time.</li>
          <li>Always pay more than the minimum due, and avoid late fees at all costs.</li>
          <li>Seek professional help if debt is unmanageable — there's no shame in building a plan for freedom.</li>
        </ul>

      <h4>Part 5: Real Stories — Inspiration From Everyday Investors</h4>
      <p>
        <strong>Ramesh: From Zero Savings to Freedom</strong><br />
        Ramesh, a software professional, began putting away ₹5,000 every month in mutual funds, avoided "lifestyle inflation," and stuck to his plan. With steady compounding, he built wealth and reached financial independence before 45.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Priya: Turning Debt Into Wealth</strong><br />
        Facing four credit cards maxed out, Priya used the avalanche method and strict monthly budgeting. Once debt-free, she started SIPs (Systematic Investment Plans) — today she's on track for a worry-free future.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Key Takeaways From Real Journeys</strong>
        <ul>
          <li>It's not how much you make, but how much you keep and invest, that counts.</li>
          <li>Consistency always beats high-risk bets.</li>
          <li>Start early — but it's never too late to begin.</li>
          <li>Track your spending, and let your money work for you.</li>

      <h4>Bonus: Deep Dive — Making Your First Budget (Step-by-Step)</h4>
      <p>
        <strong>Step 1: Know Your Numbers.</strong> List all income streams and every monthly expense—no matter how small. Use a notebook, spreadsheet, or a budgeting app.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Step 2: Categorize.</strong> Group your spending into Needs (rent, groceries, bills), Wants (shopping, eating out), and Savings/Investments. Add up each column.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Step 3: Set Targets.</strong> Assign a fixed percentage or amount to each group using any of the methods above.  
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Step 4: Track and Adjust.</strong> Every week, review your real spending against your plan. Tweak next month to hit your savings goal!
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>Remember: Budgeting is not about restriction — it's about control and peace of mind.</em>

      <h4>Part 6: SWP — Systematic Withdrawal Plans for Retirement</h4>
      <p>
        <strong>What is SWP?</strong><br />
        A Systematic Withdrawal Plan (SWP) allows you to withdraw a fixed amount from your investment regularly while keeping the remaining money invested. It's perfect for retirees who need regular income from their investments.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Benefits of SWP</strong>
        <ul>
          <li>Regular income stream while staying invested</li>
          <li>Flexibility to adjust withdrawal amounts</li>
          <li>Tax efficiency compared to lump sum withdrawals</li>
          <li>Rupee cost averaging on the way out</li>
        </ul>
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>SWP Strategy Tips</strong>
        <ul>
          <li>Keep withdrawal rate sustainable (typically 4-6% annually)</li>
          <li>Review and adjust based on market performance</li>
          <li>Maintain some emergency buffer in low-risk funds</li>
          <li>Consider inflation impact on withdrawal amounts</li>
        </ul>
